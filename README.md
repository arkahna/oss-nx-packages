# Arkhana NX Packages

## Archived

Our plugins have become very specific to our workflows, so we are no longer pushing the changes to this repo.

Once we have stabilised our approach and got the right split we would like to open source our efforts again. For the moment our NX terraform plugin is not generally applicable.
